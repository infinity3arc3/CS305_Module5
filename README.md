# CMF251-GameDEV
This is the open repository for CMF251, game development. Explore the various branches in order to find where you should post files.

## How to use for basic members:
Github is an application which will allow us to organize and control our update files when developing our major project this semester.
A basic tutorial can be found on Github's website [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).

If you are making major changes to the main Unreal file, be sure to read [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github) which describes how to make a major push to the Github repository.

## Do NOT merge any of the files to main branch
We will take care of merging files and updating the main repository.
